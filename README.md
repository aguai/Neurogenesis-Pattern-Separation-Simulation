# Neurogenesis and Pattern Separation Simulation.

Used a simplification of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) to model
a memory network (involving the entorhinal cortex and dentate gyrus) in the brain.
Model was exposed to 10 prototypes of binary patterns, and assessed on ability
to reconstruct each pattern. Effects of neurogenesis were investigated through
trials with and without neurogenesis.

## Getting Started

To run simulation, please run the following files in this order:
FINALCODE_nonneurogen.m
FINALCODE_neurogen.m
FINALCODE_plotting.m

Please note that all code was written on a 2015 version of MATLAB, so there may be
discrepancies in APIs.
